## Initial Steps

Before you start working on a contribution, please check the issues page. It's possible someone else is already working on something similar, or perhaps there is a reason that feature isn't implemented. The maintainers will point you in the right direction.

> If you still have questions, please check [the Discord](https://discord.gg/8hk49G8ZbX)

## Development

The following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:

- Fork the repo
- Clone your forked repository: `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/pawn-appetit.git`
- Enter the directory: `cd pawn-appetit`
- Create a new branch off the `master` branch: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`
- Install dependencies `pnpm i`
- Open the code in your preferred IDE and contribute your changes

> It is recommended take a look at the [Commands](#commands) and [Extra Notes](#extra-notes) sections before starting.

### Commands

`pnpm i`

- Installs all dependencies

`pnpm dev`

- Starts the app in development mode to see changes in real time

`pnpm test`

- Runs all tests, generating a report

`pnpm format`

- Formats the project according to the project guidelines

`pnpm lint:fix`

- Lints the project according to the project guidelines

`pnpm build`

- Builds the entire app from source. The built app can be found at [src-tauri/target/release](./src-tauri/target/release/)

## Contributing Translations

Help us make Obsidian Chess Studio accessible to everyone by contributing a new translation or improving an existing one! Your contributions are valuable and easy to make.

### How to Contribute Translations

All translation files are located in the `src/locales/` directory.

### Adding a New Language

1. **Create the new file**: Copy an existing translation file, such as `en/common.json`, and rename it using your language's code (e.g., `hy/common.json` for Armenian).
2. **Translate the text**: Open your new file and translate all the text values within it.
3. **Add the language to i18n.init({...})**: Open [index.tsx](src/index.tsx) and the new language to the list of imports and to `i18n.init({...})`.

For example:
```diff
import fr from "./locales/fr";
+import hy from "./locales/hy";
import it from "./locales/it";

i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
  resources: {
    ...,
    fr-FR: fr,
 +  hy-AM: hy,
    it-IT: it,
    ...
  }
```

### Verifying and Finalizing Translation Changes

1. **Run the update script**: After making your changes, run the following command to automatically check for and add any missing translation keys with placeholder values.

   ```sh
   pnpm scripts/update-missing-translations.ts
   ```

2. **Update the README**: Use this script to ensure the `README` is up to date with the latest translation information.

   ```sh
   pnpm scripts/update-readme.ts
   ```

3. **Test your changes**: Start the development server to see your translations in action and make sure everything looks correct.

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Submitting a Pull Request

- Implement your contributions (see the [Development](#development) section for more information)
- Before submitting a PR, first build the app using `pnpm tauri build -b none` and check every feature you've contributed to.
- Format and lint your code using `pnpm format` followed by `pnpm lint:fix`
- If you're contributing translations, follow the steps in [Verifying and Finalizing Translation Changes](#verifying-and-finalizing-translation-changes)
- Go to [the comparison page](https://github.com/Pawn-Appetit/pawn-appetit/compare) and select the branch you just pushed in the `compare:` dropdown
- Submit the new PR. The maintainers will follow up ASAP.

## Extra Notes

The app uses the Rust language for interacting with the filesystem, chess engines and databases, and React with Vite (using TypeScript, of course) for displaying the GUI.

- The Rust code can be found in [src-tauri/src](./src-tauri/src/)
- The React code can be found in [src](./src/)
